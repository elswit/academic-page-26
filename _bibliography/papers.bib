  abstract={A rapidly growing area of research is the use of machine learning approaches such as autoencoders for dimensionality reduction of data and models in scientific applications. We show that the canonical formulation of autoencoders suffers from several deficiencies that can hinder their performance. Using a meta-learning approach, we reformulate the autoencoder problem as a bi-level optimization procedure that explicitly solves the dimensionality reduction task.},

  abstract={Alternating Directions Implicit (ADI) integration is an operator splitting approach to solve parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations in multiple dimensions based on solving sequentially a set of related one-dimensional equations. Classical ADI methods have order at most two, due to the splitting errors. This work proposes a new ADI approach based on the partitioned General Linear Methods framework, allowing construction of high order ADI methods.},
