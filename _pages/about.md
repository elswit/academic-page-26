I am an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Department at [California State University, Long Beach](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/computer-engineering-computer-science). My main [research](/projects/) area is in the theory and applications of scientific machine learning. I am also interested in using data science to inform public health and policy decisions.

Previously, I worked as a post-doc in the Computer Science Department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu), where I also received my PhD. My thesis focused on efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications/) in SIAM, Elsevier, and Springer journals.

### Prospective Students

I am looking for inspired students to work with. You can find out more about my research from [my group's profile](/team/) and highlights of our recent [research projects](/projects/). If applied machine learning research is of interest to you, the best way to contact me is to complete a brief [interest form](https://forms.gle/YQcw92ZJorb4NmVV9).
