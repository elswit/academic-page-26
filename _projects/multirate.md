## Multirate Methods

The effective solution of systems of ordinary differential equations with components that vary at fast and slow speeds requires the use of multirate methods. Multirating applies different timesteps on subsystems. In this line of research, we create novel theoretical frameworks for building and analyzing multirate methods.

### Key Publications

* The theoretical framework for high-order partitioned Runge-Kutta methods is described in [Sandu et al.](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/130943224)
* The foundation for discrete and decoupled Runge-Kutta-like methods are laid out in our [MRGARK paper](/publications/). This is followed up by a class of [implicit multirate methods](/publications/).
* Multirate Infinitesimal General-structure Additive Runge-Kutta [MRI-GARK](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M1205492) family of methods elevates the fast integration to a continuous differential equation that can be solved with arbitrary accuracy. It is further developed by us to include [implicit methods](/publications/).
* We envision application of multirate methods to surrogate models in our [surrogate-multirate paper](/publications/).
